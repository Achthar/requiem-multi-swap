Because a memory struct uses not just memory but also a slot in the stack (to store its memory location),\\n * using memory for word-sized values (i.e. of 256 bits or less) is strictly less gas performant, and doesn't even\\n * prevent stack-too-deep issues. This is compounded by the fact that Balancer contracts typically are memory-intensive,\\n * and the cost of accesing memory increases quadratically with the number of allocated words. Manual packing and\\n * unpacking is therefore the preferred approach.\\n */\\nlibrary WordCodec {\\n    // Masks are values with the least significant N bits set.

Additionally, for each value we keep an accumulator with the sum of all past values, each weighted by the time elapsed since the previous update. This lets us later subtract accumulators at different points in time and divide by the time elapsed between them, arriving at the geometric mean of the values (also known as log-average). All samples are stored in a single 256 bit word with the following structure: [    log pair price     |        bpt price      |       invariant       |  timestamp ] [ instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator |            ] [  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |    uint31  ] MSB                                                                                LSB Assuming the timestamp doesn't overflow (which holds until the year 2038), the largest elapsed time is 2^31, which means the largest possible accumulator value is 2^21 * 2^31, which can be represented using a signed 53 bit integer.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/libraries/oracle/Samples.sol\":\"Samples\"},\"evmVersion\":\"london\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\",\"useLiteralContent\":true},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/interfaces/oracle/IPriceOracle.sol\":{\"content\":\"// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later\\n// This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\\n// it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\\n// the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\\n// (at your option) any later version.\\n\\n// This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\\n// but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\\n// MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It handles updates,\\n * encoding, and decoding of samples.\\n *\\n * Each sample holds the timestamp of its last update, plus information about three pieces of data: the price pair, the\\n * price of BPT (the associated Pool token), and the invariant.\\n *\\n * Prices and invariant are not stored directly: instead, we store their logarithm. These are known as the 'instant'\\n * values: the exact value at that timestamp.\\n *\\n * Additionally, for each value we keep an accumulator with the sum of all past values, each weighted by the time\\n * elapsed since the previous update. This lets us later subtract accumulators at different points in time and divide by\\n * the time elapsed between them, arriving at the geometric mean of the values (also known as log-average).\\n *\\n * All samples are stored in a single 256 bit word with the following structure:\\n *\\n * [    log pair price     |        bpt price      |       invariant       |  timestamp ]\\n * [ instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator |            ]\\n * [  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |    uint31  ]\\n * MSB                                                                                LSB\\n *\\n * Assuming the timestamp doesn't overflow (which holds until the year 2038), the largest elapsed time is 2^31, which\\n * means the largest possible accumulator value is 2^21 * 2^31, which can be represented using a signed 53 bit integer.\\n */\\nlibrary Samples {\\n    using WordCodec for int256;\\n    using WordCodec for uint256;\\n    using WordCodec for bytes32;\\n\\n    uint256 internal constant _TIMESTAMP_OFFSET = 0;\\n    uint256 internal constant _ACC_LOG_INVARIANT_OFFSET = 31;\\n    uint256 internal constant _INST_LOG_INVARIANT_OFFSET = 84;\\n    uint256 internal constant _ACC_LOG_BPT_PRICE_OFFSET = 106;\\n    uint256 internal constant _INST_LOG_BPT_PRICE_OFFSET = 159;\\n    uint256 internal constant _ACC_LOG_PAIR_PRICE_OFFSET = 181;\\n    uint256 internal constant _INST_LOG_PAIR_PRICE_OFFSET = 234;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Updates a sample, accumulating the new data based on the elapsed time since the previous update.

Use `fromLowResLog` to undo this process and return to an\n 18 decimal places fixed point value.\n Because so much precision is lost, the logarithmic values can be stored using much fewer bits than the original\n value required."

Typically used to pack multiple values in\n a single storage slot, saving gas by performing less storage accesses.\n Each value is defined by its size and the least significant bit in the word, also known as offset. For example, two\n 128 bit values may be encoded in a word by assigning one an offset of 0, and the other an offset of 128.\n We could use Solidity structs to pack values together in a single storage slot instead of relying on a custom and\n error-prone library, but unfortunately Solidity only allows for structs to live in either storage, calldata or\n memory. Because a memory struct uses not just memory but also a slot in the stack (to store its memory location),\n using memory for word-sized values (i.e. of 256 bits or less) is strictly less gas performant, and doesn't even\n prevent stack-too-deep issues. This is compounded by the fact that Balancer contracts typically are memory-intensive,\n and the cost of accesing memory increases quadratically with the number of allocated words. Manual packing and\n unpacking is therefore the preferred approach."

Therefore, assuming the worst case scenario where new data is\n updated in every single block, the oldest samples in the buffer (and therefore largest queryable period) will\n be slightly over 34 hours old.\n Usage of this module requires the caller to keep track of two variables: the latest circular buffer index, and the\n timestamp when the index last changed. Aditionally, access to the latest circular buffer index must be exposed by\n implementing `_getOracleIndex`.\n This contract relies on the `QueryProcessor` linked library to reduce bytecode size."

Note that a full buffer guarantees queries for the\n    past 34 hours will not revert.\n If requesting information for a timestamp later than the latest one, it is extrapolated using the latest\n available data.\n When no exact information is available for the requested past timestamp (as usually happens, since at most one\n timestamp is stored every two minutes), it is estimated by performing linear interpolation using the closest\n values.

                "text": " @dev This library provides functions to help manipulating samples for Pool Price Oracles. It handles updates,\n encoding, and decoding of samples.\n Each sample holds the timestamp of its last update, plus information about three pieces of data: the price pair, the\n price of BPT (the associated Pool token), and the invariant.\n Prices and invariant are not stored directly: instead, we store their logarithm. These are known as the 'instant'\n values: the exact value at that timestamp.\n Additionally, for each value we keep an accumulator with the sum of all past values, each weighted by the time\n elapsed since the previous update. This lets us later subtract accumulators at different points in time and divide by\n the time elapsed between them, arriving at the geometric mean of the values (also known as log-average).\n All samples are stored in a single 256 bit word with the following structure:\n [    log pair price     |        bpt price      |       invariant       |  timestamp ]\n [ instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator |            ]\n [  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |  int22  |    int53    |    uint31  ]\n MSB                                                                                LSB\n Assuming the timestamp doesn't overflow (which holds until the year 2038), the largest elapsed time is 2^31, which\n means the largest possible accumulator value is 2^21 * 2^31, which can be represented using a signed 53 bit integer."
